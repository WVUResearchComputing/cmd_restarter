Quick Start
===========

To use cmd_restarter you need:

  * The input file for LAMMPS and any other file used by LAMMPS to perform the simulation, geometries for example

  * The submission script that you will use on the cluster where you will run the jobs.

On your input file you need to add some comments that will instruct cmd_restarter about which portions of the Input will change in case you are running from scratch or restarting a previous calculation.
